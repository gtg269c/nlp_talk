# nlp_talk

A very basic introduction to some techniques in natural language
processing.

This notebook was used as the main presentation materials for a talk
to the Houston Data Visualization group on July 10th, 2017 at The
Station.

To run this notebook there are several external packages that you
will need to have available as prerequisties.  The most important
of these are:

* Tika from the Apache Project
* CoreNLP from Stanford University
* Wordcloud (available via pip)

There are embedded links to sites on the internet that these packages
can be downloaded from in section 4 of the notebook. No pretenses are
being made here as to the robustness of the embedded code -- it is
entirely probable that it will break if documents are too short for
example!

To anyone who was at the presentation -- The talk as presented had an
additional document "The First Three Minutes" by Steven Weinberg.
This document is readily available on-line via PDF download, but as I
was unable to ascertain the copyright status of the document, I
decided to delete it from the repository.
